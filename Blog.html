<h2>The Struggles of a first time HTML coder: <br><br></h2>

<p>So let me preface all of my challenges with this. I struggle with reading things correctly, or understanding what I'm reading, <br>
so this assignment got off to a bad start when I started reading and couldn't even find where to edit the README.md file <br>
because I thought I had already clicked it so I should have an edit option somewhere. Everyone thinks that should be the easy <br>
part right? Well I agree. I also had some issues with github, so I ran through both tutorials, got some help online by asking <br>
around how to do things like a simple add. I also needed some help with the formatting of an HTML file because I had never <br> 
done one before. I struggled with the assignment until Friday class because then the assignment was gone over and i felt like <br>
a total idiot, but hey, what are you gonna do. After Friday's class, everything went well, started using notepad++ as my editor <br>
and it works just fine for what I need it to. Going back to put finishing touches on everything was also an issue because like <br>
I said in the beginning, bad with reading, especially instructions.
 </p>
 <br><br>
 <h2>What did I learn from this assignment: <br><br></h2>
 <p> Well I can certainly tell you I learned quite a bit about HTML as a language. After switching from python to c++, then <br>
 c++ to c, I can tell you the switch from c to HTML was a cake walk. Not having to necessarily deal with a compiler to check <br>
 and see every time if you have the code doing exactly what you want is quite nice. Everything in HTML seems to be an <br>
 aesthetic problem, or a problem if you forget a tag somewhere, which is nothing compared to trying to do a complex math <br>
 game while running different stacks in C.

 <h2>What resources did I use: <br><br></h2>
 <p>My biggest resource would be my dad. He helped me figure out all of the internal issues I had with getting a program to run <br>
 git on, or should I say that I didn't <em>actually</em> need one. Google also played a huge role because whenever I had an <br>
 issue with github, there was usually a simple solution to my problem. Piazza was helpful when it came to uploading the <br>
 files onto the public sphere because someone had already asked the question and gotten a quick crash course in how to do <br>
 that. It was nice to see easy solutions to my problems.
