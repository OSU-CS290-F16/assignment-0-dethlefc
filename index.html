My name is Cody Dethlefs, I prefer to go by Cody.

I am currently undeclared (in university exploratory studies), and this is my third year.

I have never seen HTML code in my life, nor have I done any web development. My experience 
is in the programming world of C and C++, and even that is not very extensive.

I hope to learn if computer science is a major I want to continue studying or not, and to see if web development
interests me.

I have signed up for Piazza.

I'm not an overly interesting person. Just your average American. I love sports, specifically baseball and 
football, but I'm also a huge gamer. Video games are a hobby I enjoy, much like watching anime as opposed to the
typical college student watching netflix. I find they have better story lines. I wish I was taller, but hey,
we can't all choose our genetics. In high school, I was hit by a pitch 23 times in a span of 6 days (13 games). That's
somewhat interesting. Also this is weird for me, it feels as though I'm writing a text to my professor.
